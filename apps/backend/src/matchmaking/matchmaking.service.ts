/**
 * @fileoverview MatchmakingService - Advanced player matching system with queue management
 *
 * @dev Recent Improvements:
 * - Fixed queue removal timing to prevent player loss during failed match creation
 * - Added duplicate match prevention with Redis hash checks
 * - Implemented stale entry cleanup (5-minute timeout) to prevent queue buildup
 * - Added active match filtering to prevent double-matching players
 * - Enhanced error handling with rollback mechanisms
 * - Added clearQueue() method for testing and development
 * - Improved debug logging and monitoring capabilities
 * - Fixed queue accuracy issues by ensuring proper player management
 *
 * @dev Key Fixes Applied:
 * - Players now removed from queue ONLY after successful match creation and storage

   * Process matchmaking for all players in the queue
   *
   * @dev This function is the core matchmaking algorithm that runs every 30 seconds via cron job.
   * It processes the Redis waiting queue and creates matches between players based on FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
   * The function now includes advanced filtering and cleanup mechanisms to prevent duplicate matches and queue buildup.
   *
   * @dev Algorithm Flow:
   * 1. Retrieves all players from Redis 'waiting:queue' list using LRANGE
   * 2. Checks if there are at least 2 players available for matching
   * 3. Parses JSON strings back to QueuedPlayer objects
   * 4. Sorts players by timestamp (oldest first) to ensure fair queue order
   * 5. Filters out players already in active matches to prevent duplicates
   * 6. Cleans up stale queue entries older than 5 minutes
   * 7. Iteratively pairs available players using shift() to remove matched pairs
   * 8. Creates matches via createMatch() for each pair
   * 9. Updates queue status for remaining unmatched players
   *
   * @dev Advanced Filtering:
   * - Active Match Filtering: Scans Redis 'matches' hash to identify players already in games
   * - Only processes activeMatches if it exists and has entries (null/empty check)
   * - Stale Entry Cleanup: Removes queue entries older than 5 minutes to prevent buildup
   * - Duplicate Prevention: Ensures players can't be matched multiple times simultaneously
   *
   * @dev Data Structures:
   * - waiting:queue: Redis list containing JSON strings of QueuedPlayer objects
   * - matches: Redis hash storing active match data with roomId as key
   * - QueuedPlayer: { player: IPublicState, timestamp: number }
   * - IPublicState: Contains playerId, socketId, and other player metadata
   *
   * @dev Redis Operations:
   * - LRANGE: Retrieves all players from queue
   * - HGETALL: Scans active matches for filtering
   * - LREM: Removes stale entries and matched players
   * - LLEN: Provides accurate queue length for debugging
   *
   * @dev Error Handling:
   * - Wraps entire operation in try-catch
   * - Logs errors but doesn't throw to prevent breaking the matchmaking loop
   * - Continues processing even if individual matches fail
   * - Graceful handling of JSON parsing errors in match data
   * - Handles null/undefined activeMatches gracefully
   *
   * @dev Performance Considerations:
   * - Processes entire queue in single Redis call (LRANGE 0 -1)
   * - Efficient filtering using Set for O(1) player ID lookups
   * - Sorts in-memory for small to medium queue sizes
   * - Processes matches sequentially (could be optimized with Promise.all for parallel processing)
   *
   * @dev Queue Management:
   * - Automatically handles odd numbers of players (last player waits for next cycle)
   * - Calls updateQueueStatus() for remaining players to maintain queue health
   * - Automatic cleanup prevents queue buildup from disconnected players
   * - Accurate player counting for better user experience
   *
   * @dev Debug and Monitoring:
   * - Logs actual Redis queue length vs. processed players
   * - Reports filtering results (available vs. already matched)
   * - Tracks stale entry cleanup operations
   * - Provides visibility into matchmaking decision process

   * 2. Generates deterministic roomId by sorting player IDs lexicographically
   * 3. Checks for existing matches to prevent duplicates

   * 5. Stores match data in Redis 'matches' hash FIRST using HSET
   * 6. Initializes game state via GameStateService
   * 7. Attempts to notify both players of successful match via Socket.IO
   * 8. ONLY AFTER match storage and game state creation, removes both players from Redis waiting queue

   * - Checks Redis 'matches' hash before creating new match
   * - Prevents multiple matches for same player pair
   * - Early return if match already exists

   * @dev Room ID Generation:
   * - Uses lexicographic sorting to ensure consistent roomId regardless of match order
   * - Format: "lowerPlayerId-higherPlayerId" (e.g., "player123-player456")
   * - Prevents duplicate rooms for same player pair
   *
   * @dev Redis Operations:
   * - HGET: Checks for existing matches
   * - HSET: Stores match data in 'matches' hash with roomId as key
   * - LRANGE + LREM: Removes matched players from 'waiting:queue' list (after success)
   * - Queue removal: Iterates through all queue entries to find and remove both players
   * - Data serialization: All data stored as JSON strings
   *
   * @dev Game State Initialization:
   * - Calls GameStateService.createGameState() with roomId and player mappings
   * - Player mapping includes: { id: playerId, socketId: socketId }
   * - Enables real-time game communication and state management
   * - Rollback mechanism if game state creation fails
   *
   * @dev Player Notification:
   * - Calls notifyPlayersOfMatch() to emit 'matchFound' events
   * - Both players receive opponent information and room details
   * - Players automatically join Socket.IO room for game communication
   * - Notification failures don't invalidate the match
   *
   * @dev Error Handling:
   * - Early returns on missing playerId or socketId
   * - Rollback of match data if game state creation fails (removes from 'matches' hash)
   * - Graceful handling of notification failures
   * - Logs errors but doesn't throw to maintain matchmaking stability
   *
   * @dev Data Consistency:
   * - Players only removed from queue after successful match creation and storage
   * - Queue removal: Iterates through all entries to find and remove both players by playerId
   * - Rollback mechanisms prevent orphaned data
   * - Atomic operations prevent duplicate matches
   * - Queue and matches stay synchronized
   *
   * @dev Safety Improvements:
   * - Prevents player loss from failed match creation
   * - Ensures queue accuracy and prevents buildup

   *
   * @dev This function handles the complete player notification system when a match is created.
   * It transforms player data, emits Socket.IO events, manages room membership, and enables
   * cross-instance communication for distributed deployments.
   *
   * @dev Notification Flow:
   * 1. Validates server instance is available for Socket.IO operations
   * 2. Retrieves Socket.IO socket instances for both players
   * 3. Transforms player data into opponent setup format for each player
   * 4. Creates IFoundMatch objects with room details and opponent information
   * 5. Emits 'matchFound' events to both players via their sockets
   * 6. Automatically joins both players to the game room
   * 7. Publishes match events for cross-instance communication
   *
   * @dev Data Transformation:
   * - Uses TransformedPlayerSetup to create opponent representations
   * - Generates consistent player names: "Player {playerId}" and "Wizard{playerId}"
   * - Sets default health to 100 for all players
   * - Includes map structure, spells, and level from player state
   *
   * @dev Socket.IO Operations:
   * - socket.emit(): Sends 'matchFound' event to individual player
   * - socket.join(): Adds player to game room for future broadcasts
   * - Room ID format: "playerId1-playerId2" (consistent with createMatch)
   *
   * @dev Cross-Instance Communication:
   * - Calls GameStateService.publishToRoom() for Redis pub/sub
   * - Enables communication between players on different server instances
   * - Payload includes matchFound data and target socket ID
   *
   * @dev Error Handling:
   * - Checks server availability before Socket.IO operations
   * - Logs "Server not initialized in MatchmakingService" if server is null
   * - Gracefully handles missing socket instances
   * - Continues processing even if one player notification fails
   * - Errors are logged but don't invalidate the match
   * - System continues to function even with notification failures
   *
   * @dev Player Experience:
   * - Both players receive immediate match confirmation
   * - Opponent information is anonymized but consistent
   * - Room membership enables real-time game communication
   * - Cross-instance support ensures scalability
   * - Match remains valid even if notifications fail
   *
   * @dev Data Consistency:
   * - Opponent data is transformed from actual player state
   * - Room IDs match those created in createMatch()
   * - Socket IDs are validated before use
   * - Event payloads are structured consistently
   * - Match data integrity maintained regardless of notification status
   *
   * @dev Resilience Features:
   * - Notification failures don't break match creation
   * - Players can still join rooms and play games
   * - System degrades gracefully when Socket.IO unavailable
   * - Cross-instance communication provides backup notification path

   * 4. Emits 'removeFromQueue' confirmation to departing player
   * 5. Checks Redis 'matches' hash for active game participation
   * 6. If in active match: notifies opponent, cleans up game state, removes match record
   * 7. Handles cross-instance communication for distributed deployments
   *
   * @dev Queue Cleanup:
   * - Searches queue for player entry using socket ID
   * - Uses LRANGE to scan entire queue (O(n) operation)
   * - Removes entry using LREM with exact JSON match
   * - Updates queue status for remaining players
   * - Handles both queuing and active match scenarios
   *
   * @dev Active Match Handling:
   * - Scans Redis 'matches' hash for player participation
   * - Identifies match using socket ID comparison
   * - Determines opponent player for notification
   * - Handles both player1 and player2 positions
   *
   * @dev Cross-Instance Communication:

   * - Removes Socket.IO room membership for both players
   * - Emits 'opponentDisconnected' event to remaining player
   * - Deletes match record from Redis 'matches' hash
   *
   * @dev Redis Operations:

   * - server.sockets.sockets.get(): Retrieves opponent socket instance
   * - socket.emit(): Notifies opponent of disconnection
   * - socket.leave(): Removes players from game room
   *
   * @dev Error Handling:
   * - Graceful handling of missing socket instances
   * - Continues cleanup even if individual steps fail
   * - Logs errors for debugging without breaking flow
   * - Ensures resource cleanup regardless of error conditions

   * 2. Queries Redis 'matches' hash using HGET operation
   * 3. Returns parsed Match object if found, null otherwise
   * 4. Handles JSON parsing errors gracefully
   *
   * @dev Redis Operations:
   * - HGET: Retrieves match data from 'matches' hash using roomId as key
   * - O(1) operation regardless of total number of matches
   * - No data modification - read-only access
   * - Efficient for frequent match status checks
   *
   * @dev Data Structure:
   * - Input: roomId string (e.g., "player123-player456")
   * - Output: Match object or null
   * - Match format: { player1: IPublicState, player2: IPublicState, roomId: string }
   * - JSON deserialization from Redis storage format
   *
   * @dev Error Handling:
   * - Gracefully handles missing matches (returns null)
   * - JSON parsing errors would throw (handled by caller)
   * - No internal error logging - caller responsibility
   * - Clean null return for non-existent matches
   *
   * @dev Use Cases:
   * - Match validation before game operations
   * - Debugging matchmaking issues
   * - External system integration (analytics, monitoring)
   * - Player reconnection scenarios
   * - Match state verification
   *
   * @dev Performance Characteristics:
   * - Single Redis HGET operation
   * - O(1) time complexity
   * - Minimal memory allocation
   * - No network overhead beyond Redis call
   *
   * @dev Security Considerations:
   * - Read-only access prevents data tampering
   * - RoomId validation should be done by caller
   * - No authentication/authorization checks
   * - Exposes full match data to caller
